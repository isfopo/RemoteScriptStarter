"""
  This file can be used to create constants for your MIDI mappings
  in order to be able to easily modify and change and MIDI notes or
  CCs that are used throughout your script.

  On the main branch this file will be empty (except for this explanation)
  but other branches should contain mappings.

  Example:

  PLAY = 85
  STOP = 60
  REC = 86
  TAPTEMPO = 3

  As you can see, this is simply assigning number, that represent MIDI note
  or CCs, depending on how they are used in the context of the script.

  To add these an another file, add:

  from mappings import *

  with other import

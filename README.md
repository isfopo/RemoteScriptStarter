# RemoteScriptStarter
 A basic, unopinionated example of a Remote Script for Ableton Live 11. The goal of this script is to create a starting point for a new remote script this some tools to install into an Ableton Live instance out of the box.


TODO:
- [ ] create a requirements.txt to easily install packages
- [ ] use pipenv to copy src folder to necessary location for Ableton to recognize it
- [ ] I vaguely remember a python library that works as a dummy package for Ableton's actual live api. That would be helpful.
- [ ] have a script that make renaming the project easy by changing all occurrences of RemoteScriptStarter to any desired name. Including file names?
